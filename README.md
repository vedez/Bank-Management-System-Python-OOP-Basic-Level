# Project Name
Bank Management System

# Project Description
This project involves the development of a Bank Management System using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The application is designed to manage essential banking services, including balance checks, deposits, transfers, and withdrawals. Users can create two types of accounts:

- Current Account: Offers full access to all services with an additional Â£500 credit limit, but requires users to be 18 years or older.
- Savings Account: Also provides full access but limits users to one withdrawal and transfer per month, and is available to users aged 14 years or older.

### The system stores all relevant data in three text files:
- Customers.txt: Contains user information such as name, date of birth, address, phone number, account ID, and customer ID.
- Accounts.txt: Holds data on user accounts, including account type and balance.
- AccountsTransactions.txt: Records all transactions made, including withdrawals, transfers, and deposits.

### A simple menu interface allows users to easily navigate through the system's features:
- Create Account: Users input their details and select the account type. Upon successful creation, an account ID is generated.
- View Balance and Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history and current balance after verifying their account.
- Account Services: Offers options for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, linked to the corresponding account class methods.
- Delete Account: Allows users to delete their account and related data, except for transaction history, which is retained for record-keeping.

This system aims to provide a functional, secure, and user-friendly interface for managing basic bank operations while demonstrating key concepts of object-oriented design.
